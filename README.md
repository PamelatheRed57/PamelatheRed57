- 👋 Hi, I’m @PamelatheRed57
- 👀 I’m interested in ...Legitimate Developers 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with developers who have extensive knowledge on hackers on my iOS device and my Android and are 
Controlling the devices from my computer. 
I do not want any smart ass comments about changing passwords etc because all of that has been done in addition to changing emails and various other ways to try and 
Get rid of them. If anyone is up for a REAL challenge contact me and I will fill you in on some pretty important details that even after 10 years not a single person has been able to help. 
On top it Google helped them gain access to my account. How insane do you have to be to hand over the keys directly to the hackers with your blessing! I read that in the analytics in the device! 
..
- 📫 How to reach me ...you can reach me 24 hours a day 7 days of the week 
But beware the hackers forward my email so I don't get all of my emails 
Cc copy to all of these;
MNTEverestDesigns@GMail.Com
RulaCoutureParisJewelry@GMail.Com
Or AMVaux@GMail.Com

Please help me if you can. They are stealing money out of my accounts and block my calls etc and modify all of the apps on my device. Nothing performs the way it should, nothing. 
Also I am unable to control my Apple device because they have downloaded bogus WebKits that don't belong on my device. I have never given permission to any third party sites in any way yet someone is 
Controlling the device. They are probably going to read this and try to remove it. I had other accounts on GitHub that disappeared into thin air.
